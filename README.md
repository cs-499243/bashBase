# bashBase
Bash programs that I use and find convenient
## easyAlias
- Simple script that links to my .bash_profile so I can make changes quicker
## listerFix
- A rewrite of a python script I made to easily make files based a given formatting
- You can feed in a list of file names and it will auto create them X number of times with a certain name structure
- Currently being generalised to a "do anything X times in this way" program
- Will be linked to another script down the line that will add info to certain files and give them use
