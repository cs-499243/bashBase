# bashBase
Bash programs that I use and find convenient

## consoleNet / newsboatInterface.sh
 - ["mpv", youtube-dl]
 - Allows you to download, organise and manage newsboat feed items (Youtube videos)

## consoleNet / youtubeFeeder.sh
 - [youtube-dl]
 - Essentially it's an xml parser in bash that takes a lot of data and organises it cleanly
 - Converts a youtube playlist url into a full RSS feed (with accurate title, videos and URLS)

## listerFix / listerFix.sh [OUTDATED - IN DEV]
 - []
 - A rewrite of a python script I made to easily make files based a given formatting
 - You can feed in a list of file names and it will auto create them X number of times with a certain name structure
 - Currently being generalised to a "do anything X times in this way" program
 - Will be linked to another script down the line that will add info to certain files and give them use

## listerFix / listerFix_series.sh [OUTDATED - IN DEV]
 - []
 - listerFix addon to quickly make "series" folders with a URL link

## Misc / bashRelay.sh
 - ["konsole", youtube-dl]
 - General utilities I use to make life easier: youtube480, newk, bashRelay

## Misc / crun.sh
 - [g++, gcc, gccgo, groff, java] 
 - Compile and run. Takes a source file and compiles it how I like it

## / bashHook.sh
 - []
 - Easy inteface for everything else in bashBase. Alias and source the important files
 - Also gives a general guide on what things do
